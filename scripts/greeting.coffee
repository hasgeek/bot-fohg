Welcome to Friends of HasGeek. This is where the HasGeek community hangs out.
First thing you probably want to do is introduce yourself over at #icepick (It's also a good place to see what kinds of people are on here).

Also be sure to update your profile at https://friendsofhasgeek.slack.com/account/profile. A short bio mentioning where you work/what you do/etc would be super.

Remember to be civil :) Get in touch with @karthik or @raghu if you need anything, or drop a mail to info@hasgeek.com'''
